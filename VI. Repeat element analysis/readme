use the text files:
DMRsbetweenmorphsforFASTA.txt, DMRsbetweenstageforFASTA.txt, nonDMRsbetweenmorphsforFASTA.tsv and nonDMRsbetweenstagesforFASTA.tsv
to have a list of DMRs or non DMRs of interest, with their scaffold and start position.

Then use the script extractFASTA_from_list.pl to extract the corresponding FASTA sequences from the unmasked and unindexed Salvelinus sp. genome.
These FASTA sequences can be found under /outputFASTA/

Repeat enrichment analysis was done using the online tool RepeatMasker with ”rmblast” as a search engine and the database Dfam3.0. 
DNA sequences in FASTA format were tested against the Dfam3.0 Danio rerio transposable elements database.
