We used whole genome sequencing data from 8 charr individuals (1 male and 1 female for each morph) to call for C-T SNPs.
The list of 4 659 191 SNPs is mergedCT.vcf (currently, this file is a bit too big for github, I need to find a place where to make it accessible).

Use the maskgenomeandindex.sh to mask the genome with the SNPs and index it with Bismark.
