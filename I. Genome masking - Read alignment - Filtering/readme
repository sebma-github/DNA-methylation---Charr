We used whole genome sequencing data from 8 individuals (1 male and 1 female for each morph) to call for C-T SNPs.

The list of the 4 659 191 C-T SNPs is mergedCT.vcf

We then used this list to mask the Salvelinus sp. genome (that you can download in fasta format from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_002910315.2/), and indexed the masked genome with Bismark.
For that, see the script maskgenomeandindex.sh




Sequencing reads for the 48 samples used in this study are publicly available on ENA, under accession number PRJEB45551.


We then used the MethylKit package in R to filter out CpGs with a coverage <10X in any of the samples, with the script XXXXXXXX
