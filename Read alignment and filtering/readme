Sequencing reads for the 48 samples used in this study are publicly available on ENA, under accession number PRJEB45551.

We used 8 whole genome sequenced individuals to call for C-T SNPs with which we masked the Salvelinus sp. genome.
This masked genome is found here: "XXXXX"

Using this genome and the bismark function, we indexed the genome before extracting methylation information.

We then used the MethylKit package in R to filter out CpGs with a coverage <10X in any of the samples, with the script XXXXXXXX
