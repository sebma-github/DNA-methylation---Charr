GO analysis can be run on genes located close to CpGs of interest.
List of CpGs of interest can be found in the outputs of GLM or PCA analysis.
Using the script GOanalysis.R, alongside these CpGs of interest, the annotation from the Salvelinus sp. assembly in .bed format, canada_genome_overview_protein.tsv (Salvelinus sp. protein data) and geneidgo.db (GO IDs for genes in the assembly), run GO analysis.  
The outputs are available in the /results/ folder.
