Use BentvsLimn.R with Matrices_for_analysis_in_R.xlsx 

This is ONE example of how to run a pairwise comparison in MethylKit, here looking at Benthic vs Limnetic individuals.

But in this study, 35 pairwise comparisons were made, see PairwiseComparisonList.csv
The advantage of doing multiple pairwise comparisons is that some involve a smaller amount of samples, which means that the number of CpGs that pass the filtering cutoff of >10X for all is higher.
To redo all the comparisons, you will need to update Matrices_for_analysis_in_R.xlsx and create a spreadsheet for each pairwise comparison.

For each comparison, you will save a list of DMRs, as well as a list of all tiles that were in the analysis, no matter whether they were differentially methylated or not.

By adding all lists for all 35 comparisons, you end up with:

The total list of regions showing differences in methylation between morphs in one (or more) of the pairwise comparisons: DMRsbetweenmorphsRecap.csv
The total list of regions showing differences in methylation between stages in one (or more) of the pairwise comparisons: DMRsbetweenstageRecap.csv
The total list of regions taken for analysis when comparing morphs: ALLTILESuniqbtwmorphs.tsv (i.e. this contains both DMRs and non-DMRs)
The total list of regions taken for analysis when comparing stages: ALLTILESuniqbtwstages.tsv (i.e. this contains both DMRs and non-DMRs)
