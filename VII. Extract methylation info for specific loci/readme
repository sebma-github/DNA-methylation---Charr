use the text files:
DMRsbetweenmorphsforextraction.tsv, DMRsbetweenstageforextraction.tsv and DMRsqPCRgenesforextraction.tsv with extractmethinfo.sh
to extract methylation information for these DMRs, from the coverage files generated with Bismark methylation extractor.

Use AverageMethylationGraphs.R and the extracted .covdf files (in /Output) to make graphs of average methylation over the regions.
The results from that are in /Output2/.
Use ResidueMethylationGraphs.R and the extracted .covdf files (in /Output) to display CpG methylation over the regions.
The results from that are in /Output2/.
